"""Generate tests/fixtures/env_differential.json from Sphinx 9.1.0.

Regenerate with:

    uv run --python 3.12 --with 'sphinx==9.1.0' --with 'docutils==0.22.4' \
        python tools/gen_env_fixture.py

THE ENVIRONMENT-LAYER ORACLE. Where tools/gen_sphinx_fixture.py records
per-SNIPPET read-phase pseudo-XML, this generator records per-PROJECT
`BuildEnvironment` state: the toctree graph, relations, section/figure
numbering, std-domain object/label registries, the index/genindex adapters,
and fully cross-reference-resolved doctrees. A "project" is a small
multi-document srcdir (dict of docname -> rst source + conf overrides),
built with a real `SphinxTestApp(buildername='dummy')` + `app.build()` --
exactly what a real `sphinx-build` does for its read + resolve phases, minus
writing output files.

ORACLE VENUE NOTE (wave 4.5): projects here are ALSO the oracle venue for
the file-inserting directives (`include`/`literalinclude`) -- the two
doctree fixtures are string corpora that cannot carry the aux files those
directives read, so their node shapes (`:literal:` with `:name:`/
`:number-lines:`, `:code:`, SEVERE error shapes) belong to this fixture's
inc_* projects (T14) plus unit/e2e tests.

Design verified empirically in this session against sphinx 9.1.0 / docutils
0.22.4 under the pinned uv invocation above; see
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-31-m2-wave4-research-read-fixtures-oracles.md
section 2 (env attribute shapes, relations quirk, lazy-i18n label trap) and
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-31-m2-wave4-research-spec-sphinx-env-toctree-domains.md
section 8 (exact warning texts several corpus projects below are built to
trigger byte-identically).

Harness notes:
  - `DummyBuilder.write_doc` is a no-op and `get_target_uri` always returns
    `''`; nonetheless the base `Builder.write()` write loop (`_write_docname`,
    builders/__init__.py) unconditionally calls
    `env.get_and_resolve_doctree(docname, builder)` for every found document
    before handing the resolved doctree to `write_doc` -- i.e. a plain dummy
    `app.build()` already performs full post-transform + toctree resolution
    for every document, byte-identical to what an HTML build would resolve.
    This generator monkeypatches the *instance* `app.builder.write_doc` to
    capture that already-resolved doctree's `pformat()` text, so
    `resolved_pformat` reflects the real single resolution pass a build
    performs -- no second resolution pass, hence no duplicated warnings.
  - `env.collect_relations()` is NOT called automatically by DummyBuilder
    (only HTML-family builders call it, for prev/next rellinks), so this
    generator calls it explicitly after `app.build()` to populate `relations`
    -- this is also the only place `_traverse_toctree`'s self-referencing-
    toctree warning fires (environment/__init__.py:920-926), so
    `toctree_self_ref` below relies on this explicit call.
  - `warnings` is snapshotted from `app.warning.getvalue()` once, after
    `app.build()` + `env.collect_relations()` + `IndexEntries(...).create_index()`
    have all run, in that fixed order -- the full, non-duplicated warning
    text a real build-plus-relations-plus-genindex pass would produce.
  - confoverrides always include `{'smartquotes': False}` (Sphinx's default
    smartquotes rewriting is irrelevant noise for this corpus); per-project
    extras (numfig, numfig_secnum_depth, numfig_format, ...) come from each
    corpus entry's own `conf` dict and are recorded verbatim in the fixture's
    per-project `conf` field so a later Rust consumer can replay the exact
    same build configuration.
  - `sphinx.util.console.nocolor()` -- warning text must not carry ANSI.
  - Per-project isolation: a fresh tmp srcdir + fresh `SphinxTestApp` per
    project, wrapped in `docutils_namespace()` + `patch_docutils()` (copies
    tools/gen_sphinx_fixture.py's harness hygiene).

Normalization (the ONLY rewrite): every absolute path under the project's tmp
srcdir is replaced by the token `<project>` in every piece of captured text
(`warnings`, `tocs_pformat` values, `resolved_pformat` values) -- generation
fails (assertion) if any occurrence of the raw srcdir path survives. Both the
as-returned `mkdtemp()` path and its `.resolve()`d form are checked (macOS
resolves `/var/...` to `/private/var/...`; Sphinx internally uses the
resolved form, per the same gotcha documented in gen_sphinx_fixture.py).
Since wave 4.5 (plan Scope-8) the CWD-RELATIVE spelling of the srcdir is
replaced too: docutils' `adapt_path` spells every path of *included* content
relative to the process cwd (node `source` attrs, circular-inclusion chain
bodies, SEVERE error texts, the double-parse warning duplicates), which is
environment-dependent in exactly the way the absolute path is. The consumer
(tests/env_differential.rs) applies the mirror normalization to sphinx-ultra's
own srcdir-relative spellings by collapsing `<project>/` on both sides of the
warning and resolved-pformat comparisons, making "srcdir-relative" the
canonical spelling for both.

Value shapes: Python `tuple`s (relations entries excepted, which are already
plain lists) are converted to JSON lists; `set`s (`files_to_rebuild` values)
become sorted lists; std-domain dict keys that are themselves tuples
(`objects`: `(objtype, name)`, `progoptions`: `(program_or_None, name)`) are
flattened into a sorted list of `{..key fields.., docname, labelid}` records
since JSON object keys must be strings. The three preseeded virtual std
labels (genindex/modindex/search) are KEPT in `std.labels`/`std.anonlabels`
(they are part of the real oracle contract); their `sectionname` is a lazy
i18n proxy object and is `str()`-ed like every other sectionname.

CORPUS POLICY: one axis per project (toctree nesting/glob/numbering/self-ref/
circular/multi-parent/orphan, numfig figure-table-code-block numbering incl.
numref format styles, std-domain program/option/envvar/confval registration,
glossary term resolution, index-entry/genindex grouping, :doc: resolution).
Never remove or rename an existing project name; later tasks only extend.
